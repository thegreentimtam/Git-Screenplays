# Giving Notes

## Commenting on Commits

In Github, you can comment directly on changes made in Commits. Open a file and click on the `History` button in the top right. Here you can see a list of all the Commits made to the file.

Click on a commit to open it. You can not comment on individual lines by click the `+` button at the left.

## Blaming

It's not very easy to give notes on a screenplay based on it's **Entire History**. A better way may be to use the Blame function. Open a file and click the `Blame` button in the top right.

This shows you the file on the right, with the Commits to "Blame" on the left. Click on the commit to open it and give notes.

## Issues

For larger, more structural notes, Issues may be a better solution. In the repository, go to the `Issues` tab. Click `New Issue`. Give the Issue a title and description. You can now discuss the Issue by adding comments. 

- You can reference other issues and pull requests by typing `#`
- You can tag members of he class with `@`.
- You can drag and drop images to include them.
- You can link to parts of the script. Click the line number in Github and bring up the option to Copy Permalink. You can then link to the line by typing `[text of link](https://github.com...the-url-you-copied)`, or by just pasting the whole URL.
