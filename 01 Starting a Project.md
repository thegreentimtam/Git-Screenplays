## Create a Repository

Log in to Github, and in the left sidebar, next to `Repositories` click `New`.

Give your Repository a name, and make it `Private`.

Check `Add a README file`. You will use this file for your logline and synopsis.

## Add Collaborators

Go to the `Settings` tab of your Repository and in the left sidebar choose `Manage Access`.

Click `Invite a Collaborator` and add a member of the class. Repeat until all members are added.
