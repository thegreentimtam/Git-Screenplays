# Branches

[Click here](https://youtu.be/6NbuP1Yex_w) for a video version.

Once you've finished your first draft, you should do any other changes in Branches. This makes it a lot easier to see what's changed and give notes. You might want to create one branch called `Second Draft`, or maybe many branches targetting different notes and different ideas. It's up to you.

Other members of the class, with your permission, can also make suggested changes in their own branch.

## Creating and Changing Branches

In Visual Studio Code, in the `Source Control` tab, click `More > Checkout To...`. You'll get a list of branches, as well as the option to create one.

Now you can just commit, push and pull as you would normally.

>If you want to create multiple branches, go back to the `main` branch before creating a new one.

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests are the place we discuss changes made in Branches. Go to the `Pull Requests` tab in Github, and click `New Pull Request`. Set `main` as the base branch, and the branch you want to discuss as the `compare`.

You can now discuss the pull request just like an Issue. Click the `Files Changes` tab in the pull request to see all the changes made and make comments on individual lines.

## Merging

Once they're ready, you can click the `Merge` button to combine these changes with your main repository.
