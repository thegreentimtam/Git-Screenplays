# Markdown

Markdown is the format you'll use for every document other than your screenplay, such as Outlines and Character Breakdowns. Markdown files end in the `.md` extension.

## Set Up

Go the `Extensions` tab in Visual Studio Code. This is the fourth button down, with five squares. Search for the Extension called `Markdown All-in-one`. This extension allows you to preview markdown files as you write. Click `Install`.

## README

The first file you'll edit is the `README.md` file. Here you should write a log line and short synopsis of your film.

Go to the `Files` tab in Visual Studio Code. This will be the first tab, above `Search`.

Click on the `README.md` file. It will open.

Go to `View > Command Pallette` and search for the `Markdown: Open Preview to the Side` Command. This will show a preview.

Type the following:

``` markdown
# Film Name

## Logline

Your logline goes here.

## Synopsis

A longer logline goes here.
```

The `#` symbols represent headings. Go [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to learn more about Markdown syntax.

## New Markdown Files

To create new Markdown files, in the Files tab, right click and click "New File". Give the file a name with the `.md` extension.
