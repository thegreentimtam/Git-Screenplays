## Committing

At regular intervals you should commit changes. This is like a short summary of the changes you've made, making it easy to look back at the changes to your script and files over time.

Go to the `Source Control` tab. Type in a brief description of your changes and press `Ctrl + Enter`. You've made a commit.

## Pushing and Pulling

Press the `More Actions` (three dots to the right of refresh) button on the Source Control tab. Click `Pull` to update your local copy of the branch with any commits on Github, and `Push` to update Github with any commits made on your local copy.

> Make sure you Push after every writing session, otherwise we won't be able to see your work!
