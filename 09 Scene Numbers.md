# Scene Numbers

When you are ready to start pre-production on your film, you need scene numbers. These are neccessary for scheduling, and Script Breakdowns.

It's important that scene numbers **do not change**, otherwise schedueles and breakdowns can get messed up. Once you add scene numbers, you can't change them. If you want a new scene, it will be given a letter.

## Showing Scene Numbers

In the `Extensions` tab in VS Code click the `⚙️` button next to Better Fountain, and choose Extension Settings. In the `Workspace` tab, change the following settings:

- `Scene Continuation Bottom` - Checked
- `Scene Continuation Top` - Checked
- `Scene Numbers` - Both

## Locking Scene Numbers

By default, scene numbers will be counted from the first scene. To lock scene numbers so they don't change, go to the `Better Fountain` tab and click `Number scenes - update`. You should also do this every time you add a new scene.
