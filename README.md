# Using Fountain and Git to write a screenplay

## Markdown

Markdown is a markup syntax for writing documents. This document is written with Markdown. You'll use markdown for writing documents like Outlines and Character Breakdowns. Have a look [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for the basic Markdown syntax guides.

## Fountain

Fountain is a simple markup syntax for writing, editing and sharing screenplays in plain, human-readable text. Fountain allows you to work on your screenplay anywhere, on any computer or tablet, using any software that edits text files. It’s project was led by screenwriter John August, where it now forms the backend of his commercial screenwriting software for Mac OS, Highland.

The golden rule of Fountain is simple: make it look like a screenplay. But if you'd like a little more guidance than that, here are some simple syntax rules to remember:

- Scene Headings start with `INT`, `EXT`, and the like.
- Character names are in `UPPERCASE`.
- Dialogue comes right after Character.
- Parentheticals are wrapped in `(parentheses)`.
- Transitions end in `TO:`

Or have a look at the screenplay to [Big Fish](https://fountain.io/_downloads/Big-Fish.fountain). 

## Git

Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. There's some terminology that you need to know.

### Commit

A ‘commit’ is a snapshot of changes. Each time you make some significant changes to your script, commit them. These are kind of the ‘milestones’ which you can look back on, and even revert to. I recommend committing every time you finish work on a scene.

### Pull / Push

Pushing is the act of uploading your changes to Github. Pulling is downloading any changes from GitHub. You’ll want to pull and push every time you start and end working on your screenplay.

### Branches

You can have multiple working versions of a particular project. This allows you to experiment with ideas without commiting them to the screenplay, or to suggest changes to other people's projects without overwriting their work. You can then choose to Merge these changes into your main script.

## Github

GitHub is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It allows us to publish changes to the cloud, and provides a central place where we can discuss the project.
