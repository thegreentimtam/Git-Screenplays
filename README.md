# Using Fountain and Git to write a screenplay

## About

### Fountain

Fountain is a simple markup syntax for writing, editing and sharing screenplays in plain, human-readable text. Fountain allows you to work on your screenplay anywhere, on any computer or tablet, using any software that edits text files. Itâ€™s project was led by screenwriter John August, where it now forms the backend of his commercial screenwriting software for Mac OS, Highland.

### Git

Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Like software code - Fountain files are human-readable text, so we can use git to collaborate on our screenplays.

### Github

GitHub is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It allows us to publish changes to the cloud, and provides a central place where we can discuss the project.

## Fountain

The golden rule of Fountain is simple: make it look like a screenplay. But if you'd like a little more guidance than that, here are some simple syntax rules to remember:

- Scene Headings start with `INT`, `EXT`, and the like.
- Character names are in `UPPERCASE`.
- Dialogue comes right after Character.
- Parentheticals are wrapped in `(parentheses)`.
- Transitions end in `TO:`
