## Set Up

## First Draft

Create a new file with the name `Your File Name.fountain`. Open it.

In the left hand sidebar, open the `Better Fountain` tab. Click the `Show Live Preview` button to bring up a live preview of your screenplay as you type.

To start with type your Title Page. To get a list of elements you can add to your title page, you can press Enter. Type the following:
